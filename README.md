Download the 'Mathematics' file to use. <br />
Extract the download zip file and double click 'Mathematics.exe' to run the program. <br />
The 'Mathematics.py' file contains the script of the program in Python 3.5. <br />

Make a change of the program: <br />
  1. Change the codes in 'Mathematics.py' <br />
  2. Install pyinstaller, a python package to generate your new .exe file. Link: https://www.pyinstaller.org/  <br />
     In command prompt (Windows): <br />
        '''
        pip install pyinstaller
        '''
  3. In command prompt (Windows) under the same directory, type: 
        '''
        pyinstaller Mathematics.py   <br />
        '''
  4. Open your new program in "Mathematics.exe" inside the "dist" folder. You can create a shortcut of it, so you can access the program easily in the future. <br />
